edited ox lua fivem-appearance. added save outfits etc

In this case i use nh-context, qtarget, ms-peds, and ox-keyboard from ox_inventory interface.

You need to change/add something to make it works.

I change the structure for the ui, so if the ui doesnt works, maybe you need build files from ox github.
